excerpt: "Formulated joint task scheduling and message routing for executing task graphs over ad hoc wireless networks, capturing both makespan and robustness to link variability. Proposed path-aware scheduling heuristics with analytical bounds. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations prove shortened completion time and sustained throughput under mobility compared to topology-agnostic baselines under various deployment usecases and traffic patterns."

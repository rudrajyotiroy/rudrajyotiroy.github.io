excerpt: "Formulates joint scheduling and routing for executing task graphs over ad hoc wireless networks, capturing both makespan and robustness to link variability. Proposes path-aware scheduling heuristics with analytical bounds and shows via simulation that they shorten completion time and sustain throughput under mobility compared to topology-agnostic baselines."

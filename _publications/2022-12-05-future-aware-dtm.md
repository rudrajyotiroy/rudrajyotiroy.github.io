excerpt: "Proposed a future-aware thermal management framework for heterogeneous CPU–GPU embedded platforms that tries to minimize peak device temperature while adhering to a predefined QoS. The system integrates an analytical thermal model and performance model to create a MPC scheduler that explores task partitioning and DVFS. Short-term look-ahead capability enables improves stability under bursty workloads through smart scheduling strategies, while low-level PID controller preserves real-time guarantees even under tight deadlines. An iterative-improvement beam-search optimizer makes the MPC return the current best configuration as soon as required, promising the best compute-accuracy tradeoff under uncertain latency budget. "

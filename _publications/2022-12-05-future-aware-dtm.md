excerpt: "Designs a future-aware supervisory controller for CPU-GPU SoCs that predicts thermal and performance trajectories, then prunes the DVFS search space via beam search to honor deadlines while respecting thermal envelopes. Experiments on embedded platforms show fewer thermal violations and smoother QoS than reactive DTM baselines."

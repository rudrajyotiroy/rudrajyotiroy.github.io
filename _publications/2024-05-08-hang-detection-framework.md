excerpt: "Presents a plug-and-play ML framework that intelligently binds scalable watchdogs to part of code prone to deadlocks, to flag early-stage hangs in long-running hardware simulations (regressions). The pipeline unifies automatic binding, ML-assisted threshold prediction and iterative self-learning so verification teams can triage failing seeds sooner and scale detection across diverse IP blocks (even within co-processors executing C microcode) without retooling. Demonstrates significant reduction in debugging effort."

excerpt: "Presents a plug-and-play ML framework that monitors waveform and log telemetry to flag early-stage hangs in long-running hardware simulations. The pipeline unifies data collection, feature extraction, and model scoring so verification teams can triage failing seeds sooner and scale detection across diverse IP blocks without retooling."

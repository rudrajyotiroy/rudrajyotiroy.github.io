excerpt: "Presented a plug-and-play framework that intelligently binds scalable watchdogs to part of code prone to deadlocks, to flag early-stage hangs in long-running hardware simulations (regressions). Developed a scalable CI-coupled software pipeline that automates end-to-end deployment with segregation and robustness. The framework utilises ML-assisted adaptive thresholding so verification teams can triage failing seeds sooner and scale detection across diverse IP blocks (even within co-processors executing C microcode) without retooling. Demonstrated 40% reduction in debugging effort. "

excerpt: "Implemented raw sensor data post-processing, phase-extraction and PCA-based clustering to detect and identify multiple Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) for a novel ZnO nanorod chemiresistor based gas-sensor. Improved selectivity over single-sensor baselines while keeping fabrication and computation lightweight for portable gas-sensing."

excerpt: "Developed an RL-assisted dynamic thermal manager for CPU-GPU embedded systems that leverages data-driven thermal forecasting with a multi-objective controller to co-optimize temperature, performance, and energy. The approach learns cross-workload thermal dynamics, adapts without manual retuning, and lowers peak temperatures while maintaining real-time QoS compared to heuristic DTM policies."

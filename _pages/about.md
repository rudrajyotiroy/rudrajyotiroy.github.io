*Mathematically speaking, no one can ever truly believe in zero-trust!*


Hi there, I am Rudra (*ruh.dro*). I'm a **graduate student** at EECS (CSE) department, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I am a part of [CELAB](https://ce.engin.umich.edu/people/), currently advised by Prof. [Satish Narayansamy](https://gamma.app/docs/Satish-Narayanasamy-1bc74e8e413szqa), working towards **Trusted Hardware Architectures for verifiable computing**. More specifically, we are re-architecting High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems (e.g. GPU racks used in AI Datacenters) of the future to establish hardware-enforced verifiable computing and performance regulation. The goal is to non-invasively ascertain whether End-User License Agreement (EULA) is being adhered, and provide **remote on-chip governance** for on-premise HaaS (Hardware-as-a-Service).[*READ MORE*](https://rudrajyotiroy.github.io/blog-posts/current-research)
As a hardware-software system architect I'm broadly interested in the vast intersection of performance, efficiency, security and verifiability.

Prior to this, I was working as a **Hardware Verification** (later **System Modelling**) engineer in Low-Power Al (LPAI) subsystem team at **Qualcomm** Inc., Bengaluru, India for 2+ years. Apart from regular work on verification of IP blocks as a DV engineer, I had the most rewarding experience of proposing a novel scalable idea to auto-detect and triage regression deadlocks faster, getting it published, and implementing an end-to-end software framework (SystemVerilog, C and Python) coupled to the CI pipeline to significant reduction in triaging time and resource wastage across projects/components. I also gained a lot of grassroot hardware system design experience as I solely developed and verified a timing-accurate co-simulation model of High-Performance Audio Interface in C++ and integrated with QEMU co-processor virtual Platform to enable audio driver testing before RTL maturity.

I completed my B.Tech in 2022 from **Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur**, one of top 5 engineering instituions in India. I majored in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE), with a minor in CSE and a micro-specialization in Embedded Software Modelling & Design. I was fortunate to be a part of [HiPRC](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/resgrp/hiprc/index.php), where I completed my B.Tech thesis under the guidance Prof. [Soumyajit Dey](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~soumya/) on intelligent **Dynamic Thermal Management** technqiues for cooling-constrained embedded devices. I also worked with Prof. [Arnab Sarkar](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~arnabs/) on efficient **task scheduling algorithms** towards my micro-specialization capstone.

Interests
======
- Power-aware Microarchitecture modeling, performance/power optimization
- Hardware/system support for privacy and security 
- Compilers and Intelligent Scheduling/Load Balancing frameworks
- Scalable verification and debug automation


Outside of academia, I love to swim, play chess, ping-pong, badminton and I'm always eager to learn any adventure activities (till date I've loved cross-country skiing, tubing, snow-hiking, dogsledding, ice-skating, back-country backpacking, indoor skydiving and flying a two-seater aircraft). I am currently learning this wonderful extreme sport called [whitewater kayaking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCWgtihbhdI). I love to sing (mainly hindi and bengali classics) and play keyboard occasionally. Last but not the least, I'm a huge fan of psychological thrillers, [short films](https://www.youtube.com/@RoyalStagBarrelSelectShorts/videos), F1, data-driven/simulated [game theory](https://www.youtube.com/@PrimerBlobs/videos), ([sometimes overly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEiSTzK-A2A)) technical documentaries and all [Air Crash Investigations](https://www.youtube.com/@MentourPilot).

Hi, I am a Computer Science & Engineering M.S. student at the University of Michigan (GPA 4.0), advised by Satish Narayanasamy. I build hardware/software co-design solutions for AI and embedded systems - recently on hardware-enforced workload intent authorization for on-prem AI/HPC chips. I previously modeled Qualcomm's High-Performance Audio Engine in C++/QEMU to unblock driver bring-up ahead of RTL, and built ML-driven verification tooling that cut early debug time by ~40%.

Interests
======
- Hardware/system security and compliance for AI/HPC
- Microarchitecture modeling, performance/power-aware optimization
- Compilers and runtime tooling for secure, efficient accelerators
- Scalable verification and debug automation

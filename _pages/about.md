*Mathematically speaking, no one can ever truly believe in zero-trust!*


Hi there, I am Rudra (*ruh.dro*). I'm a **graduate student** at EECS (CSE) department, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I am a part of [CELAB](https://ce.engin.umich.edu/people/), advised by Prof. [Satish Narayansamy](https://gamma.app/docs/Satish-Narayanasamy-1bc74e8e413szqa). 

As a hardware system architect I'm broadly interested in the vast intersection of performance, efficiency, security and verifiability. I'm currently working towards **Trusted Hardware Architectures for verifiable computing**. More specifically, we are re-architecting High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems (e.g. GPU racks used in AI Datacenters) to enable hardware-enforced guarantees regarding End-User License Agreement (EULA) adherence, and provide **remote on-chip governance** for on-premise HaaS (Hardware-as-a-Service).

Prior to this, I was working as a **Hardware Verification** (later **System Modelling**) engineer in Low-Power Al (LPAI) subsystem team at **Qualcomm** Inc., Bengaluru, India for 2+ years. I created a scalable deadlock-detection and triage system, published the work, and deployed a CI-coupled framework that greatly reduced debugging time and wasted resources. I also built and verified a timing-accurate C++ co-simulation model of an Audio Engine and integrated it with QEMU for early driver testing.

<!-- I had the most rewarding experience of proposing a novel scalable idea to auto-detect and triage regression deadlocks faster, getting it published, and implementing an end-to-end framework coupled to the CI pipeline to significant reduction in triaging time and resource wastage. 
across projects/components. 
I also gained a lot of grassroot HW system design experience as I solely developed and verified a timing-accurate co-simulation model of an Audio Engine in C++ and integrated with QEMU co-processor to enable SW audio driver testing before RTL maturity.  -->

I completed my B.Tech in 2022 from **Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur**, one of top 5 engineering instituions in India. I majored in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE), with a minor in CSE and a micro-specialization in Embedded Software Modelling & Design. I was fortunate to be a part of [HiPRC](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/resgrp/hiprc/index.php), where I completed my B.Tech thesis under the guidance Prof. [Soumyajit Dey](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~soumya/) on intelligent **Dynamic Thermal Management** technqiues for cooling-constrained embedded devices. I also worked with Prof. [Arnab Sarkar](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~arnabs/) on efficient **task scheduling algorithms** towards my micro-specialization capstone.

Outside of academia, I love to swim, play chess, ping-pong, badminton and I'm always eager to learn any adventure activities (till date I've loved cross-country skiing, tubing, snow-hiking, dogsledding, ice-skating, back-country backpacking, indoor skydiving and flying a two-seater aircraft). I am currently learning this wonderful extreme sport called [whitewater kayaking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCWgtihbhdI). I love to sing (mainly hindi and bengali classics) and play keyboard occasionally. Last but not the least, I'm a huge fan of psychological thrillers, [short films](https://www.youtube.com/@RoyalStagBarrelSelectShorts/videos), F1, data-driven/simulated [game theory](https://www.youtube.com/@PrimerBlobs/videos), ([sometimes overly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEiSTzK-A2A)) technical documentaries and all [Air Crash Investigations](https://www.youtube.com/@MentourPilot).

Hi, I am a Computer Science & Engineering M.S. student at the University of Michigan (GPA 4.0), advised by Satish Narayanasamy. I build hardware/software co-design solutions for AI and embedded systems - recently on hardware-enforced workload intent authorization for on-prem AI/HPC chips. I previously modeled Qualcomm's High-Performance Audio Engine in C++/QEMU to unblock driver bring-up ahead of RTL, and built ML-driven verification tooling that cut early debug time by ~40%.

Interests
======
- Hardware/system security and compliance for AI/HPC
- Microarchitecture modeling, performance/power-aware optimization
- Compilers and runtime tooling for secure, efficient accelerators
- Scalable verification and debug automation

Highlights
======
- Graduate Student Instructor for EECS183 (intro programming, 805 students); drive labs, exams, and curriculum improvements.
- Qualcomm: co-simulation models for audio IP; ML framework for early deadlock detection; automated assertion binding for post-reset checks.
- Research projects spanning compiler-guided obfuscation (MirrorMaze), dynamic attention kernel rewriting, contention-aware scheduling, and thermal-aware control for heterogeneous MPSoCs.
